                <span class="htmlTags">&lt;p&gt;</span>Hi. I'm Carter, a second-year aspiring to work in the tech field. I'm interested in a lot of topics over a lot of areas. Some of my favorite things to do are going on walks with my dog(when I'm back home), watching anime, reading manga, and programming. Also, I love to play video games. My favorite game is Destiny 2(5k+ hours) but I also love to play FPS games and Soulborn types as well. I also love listening to all types of music genres and artists. Right now I listen to a lot of country but my Spotify playlist covers a wide range of genres from Country to rap to folk and indie rock. There is even some Japanese and EDM mixed into there.<span class="htmlTags">&lt;p&gt;</span>

                <span class="htmlTags">&lt;p&gt;</span>I have a lot of goals. But my big ones right now are to get an internship with a company in software engineering and expanding my professional portfolio. I really hope to exit this class with a much more solid foundation in HTML and CSS than I previously had. I want to exit this class being confident in my ability to make well designed and interactive websites.<span class="htmlTags">&lt;p&gt;</span>

                <span class="htmlTags">&lt;p&gt;</span>From my time at RIT, I want similar outcomes. Being confident in my ability to create things from scratch that please the user is a huge goal of mine during the time I spend at RIT. As for where I want to be when I do graduate, I hope that my foundational skills in the field of software engineering or more specifically game design are something that I don't question and something. I want to be able to create games or coding projects from scratch both in a team or alone.<span class="htmlTags">&lt;p&gt;</span>
